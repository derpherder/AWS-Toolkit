###  Find out-of-region actions
#Pattern to use:
{($.awsRegion != "us-east-1" && $.awsRegion != "us-west-2" )}

###  Find and Remove Root API Keys
#First, Find the API key in CloudTrail after enabling auditing
#Pattern to use:
{($.userIdentity.accessKeyId = "xxxxxxxxxx" ||$.accessKeyId = "xxxxxxxxxx" )}
#After finding all key use and alerting on it, switch to IAM roles

###  Find failed console login attempts
#The most important part of this one is going to be figuring out what
#a fair number of failures are in order to be alerted. 
#More than a few within an hour is probably noteworthy.
#Pattern to use:
{($.eventName = ConsoleLogin)&&($.responseElements.ConsoleLogin = "Failure")}

### Find Security Group Changes
# This will find any security group actions that make changes rather than simply listing
{($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress) ||
($.eventName = AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress) ||
($.eventName = CreateSecurityGroup) ||
($.eventName = DeleteSecurityGroup) ||
($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupIngress) ||
($.eventName = RevokeSecurityGroupEgress) ||}
